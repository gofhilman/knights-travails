# Knights Travails

Knights Travails is a program that calculates the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard to move from a starting position to a target position. It uses a graph-based approach to explore all possible moves and determine the optimal path.

## Features

- Calculates the shortest path for a knight on an 8x8 chessboard.
- Displays the sequence of moves from the starting position to the target position.
- Implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm for optimal pathfinding.
- Ensures all moves are within the bounds of the chessboard.
